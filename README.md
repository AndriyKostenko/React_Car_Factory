Hi, this is my Car Factory Website.

To start the project:

`git clone https://github.com/AndriyKostenko/React_Car_Factory.git`


`cd` into the project folder and run `npm install`

`npm start` to start the project

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
